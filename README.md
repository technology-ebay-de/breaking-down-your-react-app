## Abstract

“Jedem Anfang wohnt ein Zauber inne” – there’s magic in every new beginning. Building a new web app on a green 
field is every developer’s dream. A dream that can turn into a nightmare as the codebase grows, matures and 
finally becomes unmanageable.

React is based on the concept of components. The idea is to compose your application of independent building 
blocks that you can easily reuse or replace with better ones. If you embrace this idea, you can keep your 
platform tidy and maintainable. If you don’t – well, you can write React spaghetti code just as easily as you 
can write jQuery spaghetti code.

Patrick shares the story of his own green field project, the relaunch of the online community MOTOR-TALK. 
He talks about his team’s constant effort to “componentize all the things”, to find best practices, strategies 
and patterns to constantly improve the code base.

You’ll take away hands-on advice from real-world experience, to help you make your own code a little better 
every day, too!
